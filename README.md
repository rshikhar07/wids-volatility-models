## WiDS Mentorship Project – Volatility Models (Mid-term Progress)

This repository contains my progress for the WiDS mentorship project on option pricing and volatility models.

- Studied the Black-Scholes model and its assumptions
- Implemented Black-Scholes call pricing formula
- Implemented the Constant Elasticity of Variance (CEV) model using Euler–Maruyama simulation
- Priced European call options using Monte Carlo simulation under the CEV model
- Performed a sanity check showing that CEV with γ = 1 recovers Black-Scholes prices
