## WiDS Mentorship Project – Volatility Models

This repository contains my work for the WiDS mentorship project on option pricing and volatility modeling.

### Work completed
- Studied the Black–Scholes model and its assumptions
- Implemented Black–Scholes call pricing
- Implemented the Constant Elasticity of Variance (CEV) model using Euler–Maruyama simulation
- Priced European call options using Monte Carlo simulation
- Computed standard error and 95% confidence intervals
- Performed a sanity check showing CEV with γ = 1 recovers Black–Scholes prices
- Extracted Black–Scholes implied volatilities from CEV prices
- Demonstrated volatility skew for γ < 1 using implied volatility plots

### Key takeaway
The CEV model captures volatility skew because volatility increases as the underlying price decreases, a feature not captured by the constant-volatility Black–Scholes model.
